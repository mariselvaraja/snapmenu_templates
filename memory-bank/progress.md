# Project Progress

## What Works
- Created initial memory bank structure and core files.
- Defined project goals, scope, and technical context.
- Outlined the next steps for template analysis.
- Merged all package.json files from templates into the root package.json.
- Created a unified router system that integrates all template routes.
- Implemented a template selection page as the root route.
- Extracted routes from pizza_template_snapmenu's App.tsx into a separate route.jsx file.
- Integrated the pizza template routes into the main Router.jsx with Redux Provider support.
- Extracted routes from casual_dining_template_snapmenu's App.tsx into a separate route.jsx file.
- Integrated the casual dining template routes into the main Router.jsx.
- Removed Supabase dependency from package.json.
- Created a mock implementation of Supabase client in culinary_journey_template_snapmenu template.
- Fixed Redux state destructuring error in the pizza_template_snapmenu's Reservation component.
- Implemented real API integration for the pizza template's reservation system:
  - Created a TypeScript service for handling reservation API calls
  - Updated the Reservation component to use the service
  - Enhanced the TableConfirmation component with loading states and error handling
  - Added fallback to mock data when API calls fail (for development purposes)

## What's Left to Build
- Test the unified router to ensure all template routes work correctly.
- Add a navigation system to easily switch between templates from any page.
- Extract routes from the remaining templates into separate route files for better organization.
- Analyze the file structure and components of each template in more detail.
- Document the findings for each template in the memory bank.
- Identify common patterns and unique features across templates.
- Potentially create diagrams or visual representations of template structures.
- Summarize the analysis and provide recommendations for template improvements.

## Current Status
- Memory bank setup is complete.
- Successfully merged all package.json files from templates into the root package.json.
- Created a unified router system in `src/Router.jsx` that merges all routes from the different templates.
- Updated the main `App.jsx` to use the new router system.
- Extracted routes from pizza_template_snapmenu's App.tsx into a separate route.jsx file.
- Integrated the pizza template routes into the main Router.jsx with Redux Provider support.
- Extracted routes from casual_dining_template_snapmenu's App.tsx into a separate route.jsx file.
- Integrated the casual dining template routes into the main Router.jsx.
- Ready to test the integrated routing system.

## Known Issues
- There were dependency conflicts between various packages. Resolved by using `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to bypass peer dependency checks. This approach allows the project to install all dependencies despite version conflicts, but may lead to unexpected behavior if the conflicts cause actual runtime issues.
- The integrated router imports components directly from the template directories, which might cause issues if the templates expect certain context or setup that's not provided in the root application. This will need to be tested and potentially adjusted.
- Some templates use Redux for state management (like the pizza template), which requires wrapping components with a Redux Provider. This has been addressed for the pizza template, but other templates may have similar requirements.
- The reservation API integration currently uses a hardcoded API URL and falls back to mock data when the API is unavailable. In a production environment, this should be configured to use environment variables and proper error handling.
- The reservation service uses a hardcoded user_id (28) for demo purposes. In a real application, this would come from an authentication system.

## Recent Fixes
- Fixed a React hooks error in the eatflow template's Reservation component. The error "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" was occurring because of inconsistent component rendering. The solution involved:
  1. Lazy loading the Reservation component in route.jsx to ensure consistent hook initialization
  2. Adding a Suspense wrapper with a loading fallback for the lazy-loaded component
  3. Updating the Reservation component to use arrow function syntax for consistent export
  4. Adding a comment to the TableConfirmation component to ensure proper documentation
