# Technical Context

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend Framework:** React (likely) - Based on file extensions like `.jsx` and `.tsx`, and common React project structure.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS - Configuration files like `tailwind.config.js` are present in templates.
- **Build Tool:** Vite - `vite.config.js` and `vite.config.ts` files are present.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript:** Both JavaScript (`.jsx`) and TypeScript (`.tsx`) files are used across different templates.
- **Package Manager:** npm - `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files are present.

## Development Setup
- **Environment:** Node.js and npm are required for development.
- **IDE:** VSCode (recommended) - Based on the user's environment.
- **Dependencies:** Dependencies are managed using `package.json` and installed via npm.

## Technical Constraints
- **Performance:** Templates should be optimized for performance and fast loading times.
- **Responsiveness:** Templates must be responsive and work well on different devices and screen sizes.
- **Accessibility:** Templates should be accessible to users with disabilities, following accessibility best practices.

## Dependencies
- **React Dependencies:**  React, ReactDOM, and potentially other React libraries.
- **Tailwind CSS Dependencies:** tailwindcss, postcss, autoprefixer.
- **Vite Dependencies:** vite, and vite plugins.
- **Other Dependencies:**  Potentially other libraries for specific functionalities (e.g., state management, routing, form handling).
