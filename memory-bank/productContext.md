# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
This project aims to analyze and understand the structure of different Snapmenu templates. By analyzing these templates, we can identify common patterns, components, and unique features that can be used to improve the template creation process and provide better customization options for users.

## Problems It Solves
- **Lack of Template Understanding:** Currently, there is no detailed documentation or analysis of the existing Snapmenu templates. This makes it difficult to understand their structure, components, and how they are built.
- **Inconsistent Template Design:** Without a clear understanding of existing templates, there is a risk of creating new templates that are inconsistent in terms of structure, components, and coding practices.
- **Limited Customization Options:**  A better understanding of template structures can lead to the development of more flexible and customizable templates, allowing users to tailor them to their specific needs.

## How It Should Work
The project will involve a systematic analysis of each template in the `templates` folder. This analysis will include:
- Examining the file structure and organization.
- Identifying key components (e.g., components, pages, contexts, data).
- Understanding the relationships between components and modules.
- Documenting the unique features of each template.

## User Experience Goals
While this project is primarily focused on template analysis, the ultimate goal is to improve the user experience for Snapmenu users by:
- Providing a wider range of high-quality templates.
- Offering more customizable and flexible templates.
- Ensuring consistency and best practices across all templates.
- Streamlining the template creation and maintenance process.
