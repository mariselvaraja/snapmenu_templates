# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Fixing React hooks error in the eatflow template's Reservation component
- Ensuring proper component loading and rendering in the unified routing system
- Maintaining consistent hook initialization across component renders

## Recent Changes
- Implemented lazy loading for the Reservation component in the eatflow template
- Added Suspense wrapper with loading fallback for the lazy-loaded component
- Updated component export syntax for consistency
- Added proper documentation to components

## Next Steps
- Test the reservation form functionality in the eatflow template
- Continue testing the unified router to ensure all template routes work correctly
- Consider implementing similar lazy loading patterns for other complex components that might have similar issues
- Complete the analysis of each template's structure and components

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using React.lazy() for components with complex state management to avoid hooks-related errors
- Ensuring consistent component exports across the codebase
- Maintaining proper documentation for components to aid in future development
- Considering the impact of the unified routing system on component rendering and state management
